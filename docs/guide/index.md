# Getting Started

Eventually there will be 2 ways to run CaptainCore, hosted and self-hosted. If your interested in the easy to use hosted version, then [sign up here](https://captaincore.io/early-access/) to be notified when early access is ready or experience it as a customer through [Anchor Hosting](https://anchor.host).

Running your own CaptainCore instance requires the following:
 - WordPress site with the [CaptainCore WordPress plugin](https://github.com/CaptainCore/captaincore).
 - Ubuntu VPS running a CaptainCore instance ([CLI](https://github.com/CaptainCore/cli) + [Dispatch](https://github.com/CaptainCore/dispatch)).
